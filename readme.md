## What I learned: 
- New CSS unit - dvh
  - The height of the avaliable screen area is calculated according 
    to the state of the browser interface (Very usefull with mobile devices)
- New CSS unit - ch
  - Defined as the width of the character of the font.
- clamp function - clamp(minimum, preferred, maximum)
  - An element will adjust to the preffered value if available. Otherwise it would be nno less than minimum and no greater than maximum. 
- Using property ::-webkit-scrollbar
  - It allows to style the scrolball in a WebKit-based browser
- Checking grid layout dimensions with Chrome dev tools
