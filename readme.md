## What I learned: 
- New CSS unit - dvh
  - The height of the avaliable screen area is calculated according 
    to the state of the browser interface (Very usefull with mobile devices)
- clamp function - clamp(minimum, preferred, maximum)
  - An element will adjust to the preffered value if available. Otherwise it would be nno less than minimum and no greater than maximum.
